Measuring the colocalization between fluorescently labeled molecules is a widely used approach to measure the degree of spatial coincidence and potential interactions among subcellular species (e.g., proteins). This example shows how the object identifcation and RelateObjects modules are used to measure the degree of overlap between two fluorescent channels.

About these images:

Fluoresecent images of a histone-modified nucleosome that is labeled with a Cy3-like dye and an antibody labeled with a Cy5-like dye that is sensitive to to the histone modifications.
