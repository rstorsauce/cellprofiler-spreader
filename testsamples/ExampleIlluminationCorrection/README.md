Illumination correction is often important for both accurate segmentation and for intensity measurements. This example shows how the CorrectIlluminationCalculate and CorrectIlluminationApply modules are used to compensate for the non-uniformities in illumination often present in microscopy images.

The pipelines prefixed with "ExampleIlluminationCorrection_Example1" correspond to the images with the prefixed "AS_09047_".
These images comprise the GFP channel from the SBS Roche Transfluor image set, available from http://www.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/sbs_roche_transfluor.html.

The pipelines prefixed with "ExampleIlluminationCorrection_Example2" correspond to the images with the prefixed "—W00001—".

The pipelines prefixed with "ExampleIlluminationCorrection_Example3" correspond to the images with the prefixed "ADSAStaphInfection2_".
