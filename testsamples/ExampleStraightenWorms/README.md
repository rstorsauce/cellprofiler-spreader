Once worms are untangled, this pipeline shows how they can be straightened and aligned with a low-resolution worm atlas to extract localized intensity measurements and compare patterns of reporter signals. Included are steps for identifying a second type of objects (fluorescent marker signals) and relating these objects to individual worms, enabling count of signals on a per-worm basis.
