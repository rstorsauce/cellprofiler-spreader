This pipeline detects individual worms by worm untangling and finds sub-objects (fatty regions stained with oil red O) within the worms. Using bright-field data only, it detects fatty regions by intensity thresholding in a single image channel and relates the fatty regions to individual worms. This enables detection of rare phenotypes in heterogeneous populations, phenotypes that would be missed if population averages were observed. More data can be found on the BBBC.
